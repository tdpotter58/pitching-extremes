# pitching-extremes

This is just a simple exploration of both good and bad pitching seasons. 
First I'm going to look at the best seasons by a pitcher that didn't translate into wins.
If I finish it with that, I may also look at the opposite, pitchers who gave up the most runs, and yet still got the Win more often that not.
